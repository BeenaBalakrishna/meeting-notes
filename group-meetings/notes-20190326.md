# Group Meeting - March 26, 2019

## General Discussion

 * https://el3.judithpintar.com/symposium/ <= cool stuff

## Wei-Ting

 * Ran some coupled grackle runs
 * Seeing some high-density, low-temperature regions that form, disappear, form, disappear.
 * Current estimated opacity is rather conservative -- going to estimate overall opacity

## Jill

n/p

## Sam

 * yt welcome bot almost working!  Some minor issues remaining.
 * Didn't do much on yt, but working on the GitHub data.  Could use some sqlite3 support.
 * Can't access the database after it's created.

## Matt

 * particle file frontend refactor
 * kepler.gl, deck.gl, luma.gl are all fun

## Xinyang

 * studying trident examples

## Sunny

 * running athena simulation.  dug into the turbulence stirring method.
 * checking the energy injection rate, looking at OU process
 * comparing GPU ODE solver to sparse linear solver
     * not looking good
     * performing 4x slower than the CPU one
     * (...why?, matt asks)
 * athena turbulence method needs further study/understanding

## Meagan

 * finishing up refactoring the language options in yggdrasil -- just about done writing it up
 * matlab on windows had been problematic because of background processes.  if the engine isn't the "session leader" it will hang indefinitely.

## Alex

 * biggest problem before break: backward euler
 * implemented newton-raphson, and now it doesn't ring
 * regenerated plots, made production plots
 * now, what to do? how close to get them? diminishing returns.
 * sonification package.

## Nathan

 * still working on getting unyt working with yt.  almost ready, should have the PR open today.

## Cassidy

 * didn't do a lot over spring break
 * doing presentation on jupyterlab tomorrow for the hacker within
 * women in astronomy research workshops next few weeks

## Colleen

n/p

## Kacper

 * Working on v0.7 release -- including publishing to dataone, exporting tales as zip files and "bags."
 * merged repo2docker integration
 * Prepping for NSF review in two weeks

## Jared

 * Paper got published!  Yay!
 * Resubmitted some thesis simulations at z=2.  Thinking of doing halo statistics in different cosmologies.
 * Running them down to z=0.
 * Did a manual implementation of fixed-Q
 * TF2 looks pretty great.  Doing away with lots of the low-level stuff and making it much more pythonic.  No more initializers, sessions, variable scoping, etc.  Much higher-level API.
 * TF Agents model for reinforcement learning.  By default, they implement an environment had been working on.
 * Working on non-local analysis stuff -- reviewed vector calculus, implemented it.

## Madicken

 * Went to PyData Ann Arbor.  Gave a talk about `widgyts` and yt.
     * more business and data science focused audience.
     * unexpected questions!
 * got proofs back and going through that
