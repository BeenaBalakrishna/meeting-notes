# Group Meeting - September 19, 2018

## General Discussion

 * Ebert symposium (Katie Mack)
 * Colloq today


## Meagan

 * Cool coding things with Jupyter notebook
 * Can import models directly into the notebooks -- can call them as functions!
 * Using ipywidgets to create toggles, sliders, dropdowns, etc
 * SlickGrid doesn't seem to be supported, but qgrid does -- looking for something to build clustergrammar-like widgets etc

## Nathan

 * Last week, worked on a yt 3.5 sprint.
 * Going to move some things to a later release, but hoping by end of week to have an rc-ish email done
 * Next week in NYC for NumFOCUS summit and user forum
 * Preparing a 15 minute presentation about what yt is and what the yt roadmap "would be"

## Cassidy

 * Still doing the whole first year grad student thing
 * TA-ing a 100 level astronomy class

## Xinyang

n/p

## Matt

 * git annex

## Sunny

 * Again, working on Dengo
 * Extend range of density and temperature to higher values
 * Including h2 cooling optical depth, etc
 * With the sparse solver, the performance is 2.5x the runtime of grackle
 * **Order of magnitude improvement!!**

## Madicken

 * Worked on some git annex stuff
 * Working on feedback about docs
 * Working on PR about projections
 * Working on git lessons, on the interactive Fridays thing

## Colleen

 * cis updates: pushed a bunch of updates to the ray tracer
 * semi looks like a plant
 * Making things as "variable" as possible

## Sam

 * yt stuff -- working on loading some data, like fmri data
 * adding to domain contexts document
 * went to whole tale workshop
     * lots of discussion about reproducibility
     * gaps in the different areas
     * usability testing
     * found it really easy to use

## Kacper

 * last week had whole tale all-hands meeting at beginning of week (T&W) was supposed to be there, but there was not reservation!  and no free rooms.
 * half of the team, a bunch of stakeholders, etc, were there for the workshop the second half of the week
 * good discussions about provenance, etc, and the second half (one-on-one sitting with various people) was particularly useful with clear action items
 *

## Wei-Ting

 * Added a cooling function to GAMER
 * trying to get disk not to move at all
 * adding unsplit gravity solver
 * for initial conditions for popiii star, still have some places which don't look quite physical, looking into that
 * adding test problem that will look at convergence for gravity solver -- gaussian sphere, but don't have step function.  convergence looks great (2nd order) and error is better than tree code, but not as good as a 2D code.
