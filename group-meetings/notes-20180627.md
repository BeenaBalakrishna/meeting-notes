## Cassidy

 * Last week, was at LSSTC workshop. Learned some stuff, saw some tools.  Zooniverse was really fun and accessible.  Houdini was also cool, but had lots of moving parts.  Liked seeing how viz was important for science.
 * Before workshop, looked at turbulence was implemented in other codes.  Got some initial conditions from a 2007 KITP workshop (which were used in a 2011 paper by Kritsuk et al), and going to use in GAMER and compare.
 * Going to want to implement driven turbulence after that.  Been working to get GAMER to read in the data, decided to convert it into the right format instead.  That worked fine.
 * Trying to make sure units are correct.  Fluid solver fails because units are off -- stuff is moving too fast or things are too dense.
 * NG offered an FFTW-based turbulence IC generator.

## Madicken

 * DEMO TIME!
 * Has implemented click, will be doing drag, and has all the navigation widgets started. 
 * Pretty rad.

## Sunny

 * Working on Dengo again
 * Trying to explore how the normalization could change over time and change the performance.  Not that promising.
 * Performance changes by maybe a factor of two.

```
for cell in cells:
    interpolate_rates(cell)
    while cell_not_converged(cell):
        compute_rhs(cell)
        update_value(cell, rhs)

for rate_table in tables:
    interpolate(cell)
```

 * Running some GAMER+Grackle simulations.  Density reached is 10^10 / cc.

## Matt

 * FFAR
 * LSST workshop
 * Summer of Writing
 * Next week
 * Data repository census
 * Binary format
 * PHOEBE frontend
 * Submitted some PRs to yt

## Nathan

 * Unyt in yt

## Colleen

 * Finished up BW internship institute!  Hooray!  Working with 6 of the 20.
 * Spoke at BW symposium in Oregon.
 * Setting up verification tests for Cis, doing debugging.
 * Decided at last meeting to target SC publication deadline for viz showcase.  Working on verifying everything's working, finding big enough dataset to work with, and then actually developing the video that's required for submission.  (And writing up paper.)

* Integrated my Off-Axis Projection program with Yt's SPH projection routine
    * Currently writing tests
    * Hoping to submit my first pull request this week or early next week
* Ran into issue where running a projection and it would take 3+ hours.  SPH projection function (relatively expensive) was under scope of a loop-over-particles.  Got an awesome speedup by unindenting this code!  :thumbsup: 

## Wei-Ting

n/p, in Florida investigating collaborative opportunities with Southern Reach

## Xinyang

 * Finished [frechet distance images](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOfzlTzZthsRs2t9rLuLaMKBCS4JNk3JAr4omj768yc/edit#gid=2014273040)
 * Including all the features in a single vector for the halos
 * Learn about autoencoder

## Kacper

* Worked on various enhancement related to the upcoming Whole Tale MVP:
    * Environmental variables can be passed to a running Tale, using `containerConfig.environment` ([whole-tale/girder_wholetale#102](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/102), [whole-tale/gwvolman@b4c068a0](https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/commit/b4c068a0d81e19ff43602cf7ed5696e39d98297e))
    * Tales accept multiple sources as input data ([whole-tale/girder_wholetale#98](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/98))
    * WT Homes/Workspaces support moving data to other assetstores ([whole-tale/wt_home_dirs#9](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_home_dirs/pull/9))
* I'm struggling with writing proper tests for celery workflow (`mock` is hard...) ([whole-tale/girder_wholetale#100](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/100))

* Last week I did some tutorials on sqlalchemy and created a database to hold clump information from four different time steps in the galaxy simulation
    * Using yt spheres to get information about the clumps, this can possibly be changed in the future for accuracy
* Started working on identifying molecular cloud events across time steps (merge, dissipation, etc.) with linear extrapolation using two methods:
1. Naive approach of assuming the clumps to be spheres
    * Somewhat worked, but as it turns out approximating very non spherical objects as spheres causes issues
2. Translating each clump mesh using trimesh and checking for intersections
    * Much more accurate, but very slow. Working on using the first method as a quick initial check so this isn't as costly
* Kacper got me set up with a dxl account so I can start working with more data at a faster speed
